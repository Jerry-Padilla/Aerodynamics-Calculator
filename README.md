# Aerodynamics-Calculator

The code can solve for shock systems, Fanno flow, Rayleigh flow, Prantal-Myer expansion fans, and isentropic flow. 
A future iteration of the code may return more variables and return if a shock has detached. 
This code was mostly made to improve on the Java script aerodynamic calculator made by Virginia Tech by adding return value if heat addition or subtraction is known for Rayleigh flow.
